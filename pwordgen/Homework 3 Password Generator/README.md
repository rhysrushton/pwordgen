I've uncluded comments in JS file. 
It's still not complete, I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. 
What I think is happening is that my code is going into the string for uppercase letters and then returning 1 random upper case letter. 
The number input isn't working either.
I think it's my for loop that is the problem but I'm not sure.
